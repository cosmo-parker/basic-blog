# React, React Router, Typescript, Webpack, basic harness
Periodically you need to spin up a harness to work on [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) based features, bugs or concepts, in isolation.

You like hacking with [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)

The problem space is a bit too complex for [Plunnker](https://plnkr.co/), [JSBin](https.jsbin.com), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) etc,
while starter kits have too much cognitive overhead.

## Structure
* Minimalistic folder structure
* `Index.tsx` entry point
* Components: `App`, `Header`, `Nav`, `Home` and `About`
* `Routes.tsx` bare bones [react router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) based routing

### Getting Started
* npm i
* npm start
* [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)
